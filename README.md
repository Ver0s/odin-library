## Key takeaways
- Sometimes it was hard to tell whether my solution was the most optimal out of the bunch that popped into my head and surely some if not most of my decisions could be improved with better logic.
- I feel like I should've implemented more OOP into this project but I hope that I'll do that in the future projects.
- Creating complex HTML structure with plain JavaScript can be tricky and it needs a lot of code.
